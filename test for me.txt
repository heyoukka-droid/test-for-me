new text this didn't exist upon owner's release of repository only the file existed. can i update these changes here?
now will this appear

so this is new branch but edit on the same file the timeline it's just "organized time machine teleportation saves"
so it doesn't really differ from branch other than organizing so they could be thought as backups or saves when playing games
imagine you're playing the same game but you want to save the game but you want some kind of way to organize them
to important and experimental saves where you went off the course of what you would normally do

lol
